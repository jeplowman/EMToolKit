To run the example notebook, you'll need Python set up with Sunpy, Numpy, Astropy, and the latest version of NDCube (see [NDCube Installation Guide](https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/ndcube/en/latest/installation.html)). After that, the example should work with the existing directory structure. Let me know if not, of course!
