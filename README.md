To run the example notebook, you'll need Python set up with Sunpy, Numpy, Astropy, and the latest version of NDCube (see [NDCube Installation Guide](https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/ndcube/en/latest/installation.html)). After that, the example should work with the existing directory structure. Let me know if not, of course!

## Installation Instructions for Development

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Pip and Conda are installed.

### Linux

1. **Install Pip and Conda**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install pip

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    source ~/.bashrc
    conda init
    ```

2. **Create and Activate the Conda Environment**:
    ```sh
    conda create --name EMToolKit_env
    conda activate EMToolKit_env
    ```

3. **Install the Package**:
    ```sh
    pip install -e .
    ```

### macOS

1. **Install Conda and Create a Blank Environment**:

    - Install Conda (if not already installed):
